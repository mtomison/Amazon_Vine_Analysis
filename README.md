# Vine Review Analysis
## Overview
The Amazon Vine program is a service on Amazon wherein manufacturers and publishers can receive reviews for their products that have been provided to Amazon Vine members.  This program is available for a small fee to Amazon.  

Our analysis of the Baby products on Amazon is to try to determine if there is a bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members or not.   
## Results
First we filtered out any records with total votes less than 20.  Using this new data, we then looked at records where the helpful votes divided by the total votes are greater than or equal to 50%.

 - Number of items with 20 or more votes = 27,389
 - Number of items where the helpful votes were 50% or higher = 25,557
 - Number of five star reviews where helpful votes were 50% or higher = 12235
 - Percent of five star reviews = 47.9%
 - Percent of paid reviews = 48.9%
 - Percent of unpaid reviews = 46.8%
 - Number of Vine reviews = 463
 - Number of Non-Vine reviews = 25094

## Summary
No bias can be noted as the number of Vine reviews was only 463 of the 27,389 of the items with 20 or more votes.  Also, the percent of five star reviews was 47.9% and the paid reviews was just 1% more at 48.9%.  That is not significant enough to say that there is any bias from Vine members.
